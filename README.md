## Project Overview
In this project, we took data from a survey conducted with data professionals from around the world, of varying ages and unique stories to tell. All of this in a bid to paint a picture of just how data professionals first got introduced to data analytics, how they're getting on and other interesting information.

## Data Sources
Data Professionals Survey Data: The primary data source for this project is "PowerBI-FinalProject.xlsx", which contains the survey responses from data professionals from around the globe.

## Tools
- Microsoft PowerBI

## Data Preparation
The data source is an "xlsx" file, so it would not be uncommon to prepare the data using the Microsoft Excel app. However, since PowerBI has the Power Query interface, all data cleaning was carried out there instead. 

Since this is data sourced from survey answers, there is some degree of order to be exepected but there was still some cleaning to be done. For example, the age, salary, job titles, favorite programming languages and other columns had too much unstandardized data under the "Other" options.

For better visualization, we need standardized data, and so we set about cleaning the aforementioned columns. The 'split column' option comes in handy in this exercise as it is able to filter for the exact portions of the data in each row that we need. 

The function comes with default options, but we made use of the 'delimiter' option more as it let us split the '(' after the 'Other' option. Once the data is split into two columns, you can either do further cleaning if you need the extra data, or you can delete it like we did.

## Data Analysis
As part of this data exploration project, and considering the wealth of data at our disposal, there are indeed a ton of questions we can ask to give us insight into the lives of the average data professionals. Our analysis, however, involved the following queries;
- How many people took the survey?
- What is the average age per survey taker?
- What role earns the highest on average?
- What programming language is the most preferred amongst which data professionals?
- Where do these data professionals live?
- Are they satisfied with their Work-Life balance?
- Are they satisfied with their salary?
- How difficult was it to break into data analytics?

## Results
Our findings from our data analysis shows the following;
1. 630 data professionals took the survey, with the average age being 29.87 years
2. On average, data scientists earn the highest salaries
3. The preferred programming language for data professionals is python by a longshot
4. While more than average (5.74/10) are happy with their Work-Life balance, less than average (4.27/10) are satisfied with their salaries.
5. We can observe that on average, most data professionals did not have too much of a hard time breaking into the industry.

## Recommendations
Regarding breaking into data, judging from our survey answers and the findings from our own data analysis, I would recommend the following;
1. Start today, regardless of your age or location, it's never too late
2. Learn python, dedicate a lot of time into learning the basic skills required but python should be your main focus

## Limitations
Since only 630 data professionals took this survey, we are unable to provide a genuine picture of the average data professional.
